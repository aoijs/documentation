# $ban

This function allows you to ban someone from the server using their user ID.

## Fields

1. User ID.
2. Guild ID (optional).
3. MessagesToDelete\(In days, optional\)
4. Reason \(Optional\)

#### Raw Usage: 
```php
$ban[userID;guildID (optional);MessagesToDelete (Optional);reason (Optional)]
```

## Options

* UserID - The user the bot is banning
* GuildID - The server ID where you are banning
* MessagesToDelete - How many of the messages over x days to delete of the banned user
* Reason - The reason in the audit logs

## Usage

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: "ban",
    code: `
    $username[$message] has been banned from the guild.
    $ban[$message;$guildID;7;$noMentionMessage]
    $argsCheck[1;Just enter the User ID of who you want to ban.]
    `
});
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
We recommend adding an `$onlyPerms[ban;Error when no permissions.]` at the bottom of the command!

This way only people who have permission to ban will be able to ban other members.
{% endhint %}

Example of the code with `$onlyPerms[]` to avoid bans without permissions:

```javascript
bot.command({
    name: "ban",
    code: `
    $username[$message] has been banned from the guild.
    $ban[$message;$guildID;7;$noMentionMessage]
    $argsCheck[1;Just enter the User ID of who you want to ban.]
    $onlyPerms[ban;Only cool people with ban perms can use this!]
    `
});
```
