## Examples
We already made a "nightcore" filter for you, so there is the example:
```js
bot.command({
  name: "filter-nightcore",
  code: `
  $let[filter;$addFilter[{"nightcore": 1.10}]]
  `
//It will make your track like a nightcore, don't use it on a Nightcore Mix :)
});
```
And here it goes for a custom filter from we checked on FFmpeg:
```js
bot.command({
  name: "filter-custom",
  code: `
  $let[filter;$addFilter[{"aecho": "1.0:0.8:50:0.5"}]]
  `
//This will make the track like 8D!
});
```
We used `$let` function on there, cause `$addFilter` function returns as a message. `$let` function can be tricky kind of those situtations :)
