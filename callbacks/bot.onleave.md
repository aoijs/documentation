description: >-
  An event that gets executed, if the bot sees a user leaving a server. To let
  the bot listen to the event, add one bot.onLeave() callback inside your
  mainfile.
---

#### Code Breakdown
`$serverName` - The name of the server the user left

`$username` - The user who left the server

# bot.onLeave

This callback that allows the bot to log every user who leaves the server.

```javascript
bot.leaveCommand({ //command
        channel: "channel id", //channel where the bot logs
        code: `your code` //Message sent to <channel>
})
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure the &lt;channel&gt; is in the server. So recommended to use server variables \(if your bot isn't for 1 server\)
{% endhint %}

```javascript
bot.leaveCommand({ 
        channel: "782446718704812032", 
        code: `Goodbye, $username, hope you had a good stay at $serverName`
})
```

#### Command Handler Usage:
For people who use `bot.loadCommands()` handler.
```javascript
module.exports = ({
channel: "ID",
code: `
code here
`,
type: 'leaveCommand'
})
```
#### Example command:

```javascript
module.exports = ({
channel: "705681477169315863",
code: `
Goodbye, $username, hope you had a good stay at $serverName
`,
type: 'leaveCommand'
})
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
`GUILD_MEMBERS` intent needed! Information in the [Gateway Intents](../guide/begin/gateway-intents.md) guide.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use all guild and member based functions like [$serverName](../functions/usdservername.md) or [$guildID](../functions/usdguildid.md) or [$username](../functions/usdusername.md) or [$authorID](../functions/usdauthorid.md) in these commands.
