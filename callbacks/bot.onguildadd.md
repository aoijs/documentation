  An event that gets executed, if the bot joins a server. To let the bot listen
  to the event, add one bot.onGuildJoin() callback inside your mainfile.
---

# bot.onGuildJoin

This callback will allow the bot to log a message whenever it joins a server.

#### Usage:

```javascript
bot.botJoinCommand({//command
channel: "channel id",//the channel where <code> will be sent to
code: `Your code`//message sent to <channel>
})
```

#### Example Command:

```javascript
bot.botJoinCommand({
channel: "772414449839636490",
code: `
Ive joined $serverName!
`
})
```

You can also have it send in the server where it joined by using [$systemChannelID](../functions/usdsystemchannelid.md) or [$randomChannelID](../functions/usdrandomchannelid.md).

```javascript
bot.botJoinCommand({
channel: "$systemChannelID",
code: `
Hi i am Awesome Bot and I can do many things.
`
 
})
```

#### Command Handler Usage:
For people who use `bot.loadCommands()` handler.
```javascript
module.exports = ({
channel: "ID",
code: `
code here
`,
type: 'botJoinCommand'
})
```
#### Example command:

```javascript
module.exports = ({
channel: "705681477169315863",
code: `
Ive joined $serverName!
`,
type: 'botJoinCommand'
})
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind: Not all servers have a system channel!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use all guild based functions like [$serverName](../functions/usdservername.md) or [$guildID](../functions/usdguildid.md) or [$getServerInvite](../functions/usdgetserverinvite.md) in these commands.
