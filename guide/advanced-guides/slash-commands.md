# Slash Commands

## Introduction

Slash Commands are the new, exciting way to build and interact with apps on Discord. With Slash Commands, all you have to do is type `/` and you're ready to use your favorite bot. Users can learn everything your bot does and easily find new features as you add them. Validation, error states, and helpful UI walks them through your commands, meaning they can get it right the first time, especially on mobile. You now have one more ally in the fight against your phone's autocorrect. Slash Commands set your users up for success instead of confusion and frustration. They separate how users think and how your code works, meaning no matter how complex your codebase and commands may get, people who love your bot will find it approachable and easy to use.

## Getting Started

When getting started with slash commands, it's important to know what you should have.

### Correct OAuth2 Link

Your bot invitation link must have this checked.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Re-invite** your bot or else it will not work
{% endhint %}

### Knowing the limits

Each guild can have 50 slash commands. Remember, everything can be abused, as well as slash commands so use at own risk

### Important Information

2 Slash Commands can not be the same name in the same guild

Slash command names can not contain special symbols and must be shorter than 32 characters

the description will say "A cool slash command for AOIjs"
*/
})
```

```javascript
bot.command({

```

```javascript

```javascript
bot.command({

code: `
$createSlashCommand[$guildID;version;Return's Aoi.js's current version]`
//This will make our slash command
})
```

 name: "version", 
 code: `$interactionReply[Package Version: $packageVersion]`
 })
 bot.onInteractionCreate()
```
